1. Write a query to display the ff columns ID (shouldstartwith T + 11 digits of trn_teacher.id with leading zeroslike'T00000088424'), Nickname, Status and Roles (like Trainer/Assessor/Staff) using table trn_teacher and trn_teacher_role.


SELECT 
    INSERT(employee.id, 1, 0, 'T') AS ID,
    Nickname,
    Status,
    role.employee_role AS Role
FROM
    (SELECT 
        LPAD(id, 11, '0') AS id,
            nickname AS Nickname,
            status AS Status
    FROM
        trn_teacher) AS employee
        LEFT JOIN
    (SELECT 
        teacher_id,
            CASE
                WHEN role = 1 THEN 'Trainer'
                WHEN role = 2 THEN 'Assessor'
                ELSE 'Staff'
            END AS employee_role
    FROM
        trn_teacher_role) AS role ON employee.id = role.teacher_id;


2. Write a query to display the ff columns ID (from teacher.id),Nickname, Open (total open slots from trn_teacher_time_table),Reserved (total reserved slots from trn_teacher_time_table),Taught (total taught from trn_evaluation) and NoShow (totalno_show from trn_evaluation) using all tables above. Shouldshow only those who are active (trn_teacher.status = 1or2)and those who have both Trainer and Assessor role. 


SELECT 
    id AS ID, nickname AS Nickname, status AS 'Open', Taught, noshow as 'No Show'
FROM
    trn_teacher AS teacher
        LEFT JOIN
    (SELECT 
        teacher_id, SUM(status)
    FROM
        trn_time_table
    WHERE
        status = 1
    GROUP BY teacher_id) AS time_table ON time_table.teacher_id = teacher.id
        LEFT JOIN
    (SELECT 
        teacher_id,
            SUM(CASE
                WHEN result = 1 THEN result
                ELSE 0
            END) AS Taught,
            SUM(CASE
                WHEN result = 2 THEN 1
                ELSE 0
            END) AS 'noshow'
    FROM
        trn_evaluation
    GROUP BY teacher_id) AS evaluation ON evaluation.teacher_id = teacher.id
WHERE
    status > 0;
